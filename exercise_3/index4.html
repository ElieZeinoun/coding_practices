    <pre>
        This is a preformatted text, 
        here a line break should execute as written
        in the html. 

        Two line breaks.     Spaces.    Everything works as planned. 
        This is particularly useful for a poem. 
    </pre>
    <p>
        This on the other hand is a paragraph, 
        where line breaks,     spaces, everything is ignored. 
        The front is different as well. <hr>
        However, the "hr" tag can be used to indicate a thematic break. It also adds a line underneath that spans the whole page.
